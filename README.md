# HS_ChainLighting

Links lighting to the Workspace visibility hierarchy, like other items behave making 'hiding' a light disable it.

Requires: HSExtSave, Harmony (1.0.9.1+) [included just in case] and ModSettings Menu.

Press Alt+L (default) to bring up the interface. Enable/disable the link as desired.

Control Embedded Lights: This option will also disable any lights attached to studio items that aren't themselves lights. Otherwise the base game behaviour of hiding the item but leaving the light will govern.
